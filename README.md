# shiny-engine
The shiny-engine is a modular distributed game server framework. Nodes and nodes use registration to associate messages for automatic routing. You can use the tool to generate the game logic structure data code into the framework, reducing the need to manually write tedious code.

Currently supports Window 64-bit systems and linux ubuntu 64-bit systems. Communication between nodes uses protobuf, zeromq, but communication with clients uses Socket TCP. Database currently only supports mysql.

The server architecture can look at some of the files in the doc directory. The current documentation is quite simple, mainly because the author is too lazy. Of course, follow-up will continue to complete the document and continue to improve the project.
